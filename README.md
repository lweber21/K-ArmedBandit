# K-ArmedBandit
python code to experiment with the k-armed bandit problem as defined in Chapter 2 of **Reinforcement Learning** by 
Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.  

- *Bandit.py* creates a k-armed bandit object each with mean zero and inputted standard deviation that defaults to 1
- *AgendtBandit.py* creates an instance of a k-armed bandit and learns estimates of mean of each arm of the bandit using the
sample average method
